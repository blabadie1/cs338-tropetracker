he got plastered
he got the short end of the stick
he has a few loose screws
he has a way with words
he has egg on his face
he is toast
he knows which side his bread is buttered on
he learned his lesson
he left no stone unturned
he let the cat out of the bag
he looks like death warmed up
he made a mad dash for it
he never met a doughnut he didn't like
he put one over on me
he single-handedly destroyed an empire
he speaks with a forked tongue
he spilled the beans
he was aladdin in an orchard dripping with diamonds
he was just a port in the storm
he was talking into his hat lying
he was the life of the party
he went the whole nine / 9 yards
he who can does; he who cannot teaches
he who cannot dance blames the dj
he who hesitates is lost
he who laughs last laughs best
he who lives by the sword shall die by the sword
he will give the devil his due
he won hands down
he is as dense as a london fog
he silenced the critics
head over heels
heading for the poor house
heads up
heard it through the grapevine
heart of gold
heaven help us
heavens to betsy
hedge your bets
heebie-jeebies
hell-bent for leather
hell has no fury like a woman scorned
hell or high water
helter-skelter
hem and haw
hen pecked
her biological clock is ticking
here lies one whose name was writ in water
here today gone tomorrow
here's mud in your eye
here's your hat what's your hurry
he's a bald-faced liar
he's a bubble shy of plumb
he's a corn-fed hick
he's a dark horse
he's a fall guy
he's a smooth operator
he's all flibberty jibbets
he's always blowing his own horn
he's an easy study
he's an inch deep and a mile wide
he's bitten off more than he can chew
he's built like a brick shit-house
he's changing his tune
he's chomping at the bit
he's dressed to the nines
he's feeling his oats
he's fishing for compliments
he's gone to ground
he's got a bug up his ass
he's got more money than he knows what to do with
he's got the skills to pay the bills
he's gunning for a fight 
he's hen pecked
he's milk toast
he's not playing with a full deck
he's not the sharpest knife in the cabinet
he's over the hill
he's pulling your leg
he's pushing up daisies
he's really laying it on thick
he's really on the ball
he's scared of his own shadow
he's so matter-of-fact
he's so ugly he'd have to sneak up on a glass of water to get a drink
he's the south end of a north-bound horse
he's thinking with the wrong head
he's waiting for his ship to come in
het up
hide the salami
higgledy piggledy
high and dry
high as a kite
high hopes
high time
high wide and handsome
high-flyer
highway robbery
his bark is worse than his bite
his elevator doesn't go to the top floor
his eyes are bigger than his stomach
his left hand doesn't know what his right hand is doing
his mouth is writing checks his body can't cash
hissy fit
history repeats itself
hit below the belt
hit every ugly branch falling out of the tree
hit him right between the numbers
hit the books
hit the deck
hit the ground running
hit the hay
hit the nail on the head
hit the sack
hoist by your own petard
hoity-toity
hold down the fort
hold the phone
hold your horses
holding all the cards
holier than thou
home is where the heart is
home is where you hang your hat
hook line and sinker
hop skip and a jump
hope against hope
hope springs eternal
horse around 
horse of a different color
horse play
horsing around
hot as hell
hot enough for you
hot enough to fry an egg
hot off the press
hot on the heels
hot under the collar
hotter than a fox in a firestorm
houston we have a problem
how are the mighty fallen
how do i love thee
how now brown cow
how sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child
how's it hanging
how's that for a topper
hugged him closer than peel does a banana
hump day
hunker down
hunky dory
hurl insults
hurts like the dickens
i beg to differ
i bought it for a song
i busted my hump
i can't stand it
i can't stomach that
i could eat a horse
i could whip you with one arm tied behind my back
i didn't expect the spanish inquisition
i don't give a fig
i don't give a jot
i hate to say this but
i have a bone to pick with you
i have an ax to grind
i have not slept one wink
i have nothing to declare but my genius
i have nothing to offer but blood toil tears and sweat
i haven't a clue
i haven't the foggiest
i need that like a hole in the head
i need that like a moose needs a hat rack
i ought to tan your hide
i put two and two together
i quit smoking cold turkey
i second that
i smell a rat
i spy with my little eye
i trust him as far as i can throw him
i want my place in the sun
i was roped into it
i wasn't born yesterday
i will give you that to boot
i will go to the foot of our stairs
i will wear my heart upon my sleeve
i wouldn't p#ss on your teeth if they were on fire
i wouldn't trust him as far as i could spit
ice water in his veins
icing on the cake
i'd bet my bottom dollar
i'd lose my head if it wasn't attached
i'd rather be a hammer than a nail
i'd rather have a bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy
idle chit-chat
idle hands are the devil's workshop
if a frog had wings he wouldn't bump his ass hopping
if a tree falls in the forest does it make a sound
if at first you don't succeed try try again
if god had meant for man to fly he would've given us wings
if his word were a bridge - you'd be afraid to cross
if i had my druthers
if i were in his shoes
if it ain't broke don't fix it
if it weren't for bad luck i'd have no luck at all
if it's not one thing it's another
if i've said it once i've said it a thousand times
if looks could kill
if music be the food of love play on
if the mountain won't come to mohammed mohammud must go to the mountain
if the shoe fits wear it
if wishes were horses beggars would ride
if you can't beat 'em join 'em
if you can't find it grind it
if you can't kill the king then don't wound him
if you can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen
if you can't take mohammed to the mountain take the mountain to mohammed
if you chase two rabbits both will escape
if you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all
if you get the sense then chuck the tense
if you love something set it free
if you play your cards right
if you think that you have another think coming
if you were any closer it would bite you
if your foresight was as good as your hindsight we would be better by a far sight
if you're going to talk the talk you better walk the walk
if you've seen one you've seen 'em all
ignorance is bliss
ignorance of the law is no excuse
i'll be a monkey's uncle
i'll be damned
i'll be the judge of that thank you
i'll be there with bells on
i'll bet a dollar to a donut
i'll eat my hat
i'll fix you
i'll fix your little red wagon
i'll leave you with something to chew on
i'll procrastinate later
i'll punch his lights out
i'll see you in hell
i'm going bananas
i'm gonna clean your clock
i'm gonna lay down the law
i'm gonna wash that man right outta my hair
i'm in hog heaven
i'm not getting any younger
i'm on a roll
imitation is the sincerest form of flattery
in a new york minute
in a nutshell
in a pickle
in a pig's eye
in a quandary
in a trice
in a wink
in an interesting condition
in bed with one's boots on
in cahoots with
in every life a little rain must fall
in fine fettle
in for a fleecing
in for a penny in for a pound
in for the long haul
in full cry
in harm's way
in my mind's eye
in one ear and out the other
in one fell swoop
in over your head
in seventh heaven
in stitches
in the bag
in the black
in the box-seat
in the buff
in the cards
in the clear
in the dark
in the doghouse
in the doldrums
in the hot seat
in the joint
in the limelight 
in the money
in the nick of time
in the offing
in the pink
in the red 
in the rough
in the twinkling of an eye
in your dreams
in your face
indian summer
innocent as the day he was born
irons in the fire
is a pig pork
is it soup yet
is nothing sacred
is the pope catholic
is this a dagger which i see before me
isn't all it's cracked up to be
it ain't over till the fat lady sings
it ain't rocket science
it all boils down to this
it came like a bolt from the blue
it is a long road without a turn
it is all grist to the mill
it is better to give than to receive
it is better to light a candle than curse the darkness
it isn't all sweetness and light
it just goes to show
it never rains but it pours
it sounds like a thrashing machine
it stands to reason
it takes two to tango
it takes two fools to argue
it took my breath away
it was a piece of cake
it was a white-knuckle ride
it was an ill-fated idea
it will be a cold day in hell
it will do
it won't fly
it's no use crying over spilled milk
it's a dog-eat-dog world
its a dog's life
it's a doozy
it's a freckle past a hair
it's a game of inches
it's a lemon
it's a long shot
it's a one-horse town
its a sure thing
it's a wash
it's all cut and dried
it's all fun and games until someone loses an eye
it's all greek to me
it's all in your head
it's all over but the crying
its all topsy turvy
it's an ill wind that blows no good
it's autumn in her mouth and all her tongue can do is rustle
it's better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick
it's cutting edge
it's darkest just before the dawn
it's got a great beat but you can't dance to it
it's in the bag
it's just one of those days i guess
it's like my daddy used to say
it's neck and neck
it's never too late to learn
it's not a sprint it's a marathon
it's not all it's cracked up to be
it's not over till it's over
it's not the heat it's the humidity
it's not the size of the dog in the fight it's the size of the fight in the dog
it's not whether you win or lose it's how you play the game
it's not written in stone
it's nothing earth-shattering
it's on the tip on my tongue
it's only a matter of time
it's raining like a cow pissing on a flat rock
it's what's on the inside that counts
i've been had
i've got a monkey on my back
i've got it covered
i've got other fish to fry
i've had it up to here
ivory tower
jack of all trades and a master of none
jockeying for position

joined at the hip
jump down your throat
jump in with both feet
jump on the bandwagon

just a cotton pickin' minute here
just a drop in the bucket
just a minute
just a second
just admiring the view
just around the bend
just as sweet as you please
just fell off the turnip truck
just like riding a bike
just the tip of the iceberg
just thought i'd throw that in
just washed my hair and can't do a thing with it
just what the doctor ordered

young loins
young dumb and full of rum
your ass is grass
your father wasn't a glass maker
your goose is cooked
your name is mud
your place or mine
you're a good egg
you're all wet
you're dead meat
you're driving me insane
you're going to get it
you're off your rocker
you're the gleam in your father's eye
you've got more front than myers
zigged when he should have zagged
zip it
zip your lip
